# simple-counter

The project contain the counter of "INCREMENT" button clicks. Each button click is saved and displayd down below the "SAVE" button

## The tasks I faced:
- setting up JavaScritp file
- writing string and number variables
- creating basic mathematical operations
- adding onclick event listener
- writing functions (increment and save)
- displaying the count with innerText and textContent
